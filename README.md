============
A neat AI for 2048 created with Python 3.6

## General info
Here is just a simple neat AI which will be able to play at 2048.  
I'm so happy that it works but it's not totally finished.  
First, the AI isn't trained or not a lot because it will probably take many days to reach the maximum score of 2048 but if I do it one day, I will give you the best genome.  
I also want to make a 4x4 graphic grid you will be able to match to a real 2048 game, like on a browser and the AI will recognize the numbers in the squares and play the game for us.

## Speed
I tried to make the code as optimized as possible and it runs at **more than 800 generations of 100 populations per minute**
